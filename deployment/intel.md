5. **Connect via SSH** with port forwarding
6. **Access services** through forwarded ports

## Access Configuration

Intel Tiber Cloud uses SSH jump host access:

```bash
# SSH connection format
ssh -J guest@[jump-host] sdp@[target-host]

# Deployment command
./deploy-tiber guest@[jump-host] sdp@[target-host] [deployment-package]

# Port forwarding
./port-forward guest@[jump-host] sdp@[target-host]
```

## Access Points

Once deployed, you'll have access to:

- **TrustGraph API**: Port 8089 (forwarded from 8088)
- **Web Workbench**: Port 8889 (forwarded from 8888)
- **Grafana Monitoring**: Port 3001 (forwarded from 3000)
